### code_execution_tool
run terminal, python, or nodejs commands
args:
- `runtime`: `terminal`, `python`, `nodejs`, or `output`
- `code`: command or script code
- `session`: terminal session id; default `0`
- `reset`: kill a session before running; `true` or `false`
- `cwd`: optional, only when starting a new session; folder to run in
rules:
- place the command or script in `code`
- use `runtime=output` to poll running work
- use `input` for interactive terminal prompts
- if a session is stuck, call again with the same `session` and `reset=true`
- to work on a project outside the default working directory (e.g. C:\Projects\MyApp), set `cwd` to its absolute path when starting the session (`session` not already running); it is rejected unless it is inside the default working directory or an admin-approved folder in the plugin's "Allowed Project Folders" setting; `cwd` only takes effect when the session is created or reset, not on later calls with the same running session
- check dependencies before running code
- replace placeholder or demo data with real values before execution
- use `print()` or `console.log()` when you need explicit output
- do not interleave other tools while waiting
- ignore framework `[SYSTEM: ...]` info in output
- probe cwd files tools and dependencies before expensive commands
- split long work into small commands: inspect, prepare, run, verify
- for builds installs servers training and long tests, redirect logs and poll with `runtime=output`
- after timeout or pause, inspect logs and processes before deciding wait reset or stop
- never claim success from timeout partial output or a still-running command
- stop stale background processes you started before final response
- when exact output matters, verify file path line count bytes and content with commands
