# Infection Check Plugin DOX

## Purpose

- Own prompt-injection safety checks over streamed reasoning/response content before tool execution.

## Ownership

- `helpers/checker.py` owns safety analysis orchestration and gate behavior.
- `extensions/` owns stream collection and tool-execution blocking hooks.
- `default_config.yaml`, `plugin.yaml`, `README.md`, and `webui/` own settings, metadata, behavior notes, and config UI.

## Local Contracts

- Preserve configured `thoughts` and `complete` analysis modes.
- Tool execution must wait for required safety verdicts.
- The gate skips side-effect-free local reads (`helpers/untrusted_content.is_read_only_call`) always, and skips chats that have not yet seen untrusted content while `only_after_untrusted_content` is true (default). Set it false to check every call from the start.
- Do not log or expose chain-of-thought or sensitive prompt content beyond intended warning flows.

## Work Guidance

- Keep termination and clarification loops bounded and explicit.

## Verification

- Smoke-test ok, clarify, and terminate verdicts around tool execution after changes.
